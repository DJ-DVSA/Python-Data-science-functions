# My Reference of Useful Python Data Analysis/Science code snippets

This is a Flask application which generates static web pages which can be hosted on GitHub pages.
The aim of this repo is to act as a quick reference for useful pieces of Python code and how to use certain library functions for data analysis which I want to remember.

The Flask app will read code, markdown and outputs from JuPyTer notebooks and append it to the relevant page. The notebook name should contain reference to main Python library that the code uses (i.e., pandas, matplotlib)

Note: Though this application will run as a dynamic Flask app, the hyperlinks on the main page will not work properly.
